This idea is the continental drift hypothesis.\n                    Wegener drew from several different sources of data to support his hypotheses: the correlation of\n                    coastlines; the distribution of late paleozic glaciers; the distribution of late paleozoic climatic\n                    belts; the disruption of fossil species; and correlation of distinctive rock assemblages now on\n                    opposite sides of the ocean.\n                </p>\n                <p>Rocks retain a record of the Earth’s magnetic field that existed at the time the rocks formed/ this\n                    record is called paleomagnetism. Nu measuring paleomagnetism in successively older rocks, geologist\n                    discovered apparent polar-wander paths.\n                    Apparent polar-wander paths are different for different continents. Continents move with respect to\n                    one another, while the earth's magnetic poles remain roughly fixed.\n                </p>\n                <p>Around 1960, harry hess proposed the hypotheses of se-floor spreading. According to this hypotheses,\n                    new sea floor forms at mid-ocean ridges, above a band of upwelling mantle, then spreads\n                    symmetrically away from the ridge axis. Eventually, the ocean floor sinks back in the mantle at\n                    deep-ocean trenches.\n                </p>\n                <p>Magnetometer surveys of the sea floor revealed marine magnetic anomalies. Positive anomalies, where\n                    the magnetic field strength is greater than expected, and negative anomalies, where the magnetic\n                    field strength is less than expected, are arranged in alternating stripes.\n                </p>\n\n                <p>Geologist documented that the earths’ antigenic field reverses polarity every now and then.

Boundaries between plates are convergent (where plates move towards\n                        each other) , divergent (where plates are pushed apart at mid0ocean ridge) or transform (where\n                        plates slide past each other).

What was his evidence? Why doesnt  other geologist all agree?\n                </p>\n                <p> <span>A.</span> Wegener stated that the continents had once been contiguous, forming a supercontintne which he termed Pangaea which later broke apart to form the modern continents and the n drifted to their present configuration. Wegener’s evidence included the fit of continents coastlines and the distributions  of late Paleozoic fossils, rocks, and climatic belts, all of which were explained by fixed continents. Most geologist did not accept the continental drift hypotheses primarily because wegner had no working mechanism to explain what would cause continents to move.\n                </p>\n                <p>2. how do apparent polar-wander paths show that the continents, rather than the poles, have moved?\n                </p>\n                <p> <span>A.</span> Apparent polar-wander paths for different continents do not agree with one another concerning the position of the ancient magnetic north pole. Magnetic poles can potentially wander, but as earth's magnetic field is largely a dipole field, there is only one possible position at any one time for an ancient north pole. \n                </p>\n                <p>3. describe the hypothesis of sea-floor spreading?\n                </p>\n                <p> <span>A.</span> Sea-floor spreading is the idea the new oceanic basalt is produced at mid-ocean ridges and spread laterally to either side. It is in part the push of oceanic basalt that causes the continents to drift over the surface of the earth.\n                </p>\n\n                <p>4. Describe the pattern of marine magnetic anomalies  across a mid-ocean ridge. How is this pattern explained?\n                </p>\n                <p> <span>A.</span> Over the ridge crest, earth’s magnetic field is anomalously strong a positive anomaly. This elongate belt of positive anomaly is flanked on either side by belts of anomalously weak magnetic field strength negative anomaly. The alternating sequence of positive and negative anomalies continues in either direction outward from the ridge, forming a pattern that possesses mirror0image symmetry about the ridge axis. The explanation of the pattern is that magnetic fields of crystals formed in the most recent past have remnant magnetism in concert with today’s global magnetic field and are said to hav normal polarity. Extra field strength derives from the alignment of all these mini magnets reinforce the modern dipole. The same is true for all positive anomalies, repressing crystallization and cooling that took place during the times when earth's magnetic polarity was the same as it is today.  Negative anomalies are derived from bodies of rock that crystallized and cooled during times when earths magnetic field had a polarity opposite to that of today. The magnetic fields of these rocks destructively interfere with the modern dipole, weakening the observe magnetic strength. \n                </p>\n\n                <p>5. how did drilling into the sea floor contribute further proof of sea-floor spreading? How did the seafloor-spreading hypothesis explain variations in ocean floor heat flow?\n                </p>\n                <p> <span>A.</span> Sediments atop oceanic basalts become thicker away form mid-ocean ridges, and the lowermost layers become progressively older with increasing distance from the ridge. Heat flow is greatest near the mid-ocean ridges, where hot mantle rock is rising partially melting to yield new basalts. With increasing distance away from the ridges, rates of heat flow decrease.\n                </p>\n\n\n                <p>6. what are the characteristics of the lithosphere plate? Can a single plate include both continental and oceanic lithosphere?\n                </p>\n                <p> <span>A.</span> The lithosphere is the rocky portion of the earth, relatively cool and rigid as compared to underlying mantle material the hotter, weaker stenographer. The lithosphere is composed of the crust and the uppermost portion to the mantle. A plate may be topped by a combination of continental and oceanic crust. \n                </p>\n\n\n                <p>7. how does oceanic lithosphere differ from continental lithosphere in thickness. Composition, and density?\n                </p>\n                <p> <span>A.</span> Oceanic lithosphere is thinner and denser, with a more mafic crust largely basaltic whereas continents crust is granitic\n                </p>\n\n\n\n\n                <p>8. how do we identify a plate boundary?</p>\n                <p> <span>A.</span> Plate boundaries are marked by linear or arc-like segments of relatively high earthquake frequency earthquake belt.\n                </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                <p>9. describe the three types of plate boundaries.\n                </p>\n                <p> <span>A.</span>Divergent plate boundaries exist where lithosphere on either side moves away from the boundary. At convergent plate boundaries, lithosphere on either side comes together, bringing either subduction of oceanic lithosphere ,  or collision of two continental plates. At transform plate boundaries, plates slide past each other. \n                    </p>\n\n\n                    <p>10. how does crust form along a mid-ocean ridge?

Some  of the magma crystallizes beneath the surface as gabbro or in thin basatlic dikes, and some erupts to form volcanic lava, which flows and ultimately solidifies to form pillow basalt; the water issued from the chimney is black due to minerals that come out of solutions s the superheated water cools on contact with surrounding  colder water.\n                    </p>   \n\n\n\n\n                        <p>11. why is the oldest oceanic lithosphere found on the earth today less than 200 million years old?</p>\n                                <p> <span>A.</span> Oceanic lithosphere greater than 200 million years old has been subjected down trenches.</p>   \n\n\n                                    <p>12. describe the major features of a convergent boundary.</p>\n                                <p> <span></span> If the convergent boundary is a subduction  zone, it is marked by a deep trench where the subducting oceanic plate bends downward in opposition to the horizontal overriding plate. Sediments scrape off the subducting plate to form an accretionary prism at the edge of the overriding plate. Behind the prism, the melting associated with the subducting plate produces either a volcanic continental arc or a volcanic island arc. If a collisional boundary is present instead of a subduction zone, then a broad, thick, non volcanic mountain range will be present. \n                                </p>   \n\n\n                                    <p>13. why are transform plate boundaries required on an earth with spreading and subducting plate boundaries?\n                                    </p>\n                                <p> <span>A.</span> Transform plate motion is a necessary transition between convergence and divergence.\n                                </p>   \n\n                                    <p>14.

Hot spots are relatively stable points, where as the plates that overlie them, and which bear the associated volcanoes, are moving. Over periods of millions of years, as a plate slides over the hot spot, extinct volcanoes are ferried in the direction of plate  motion, while new volcanoes are formed at the hot spot. Only the volcano directly over a hot spot will be active; all those dragged off a host spot lose their source of magma.\n                                </p>   \n                                    <p>16.Describe the characteristics of a continental rift, and give examples of where this process is occurring today.\n                                    </p>\n                                <p> <span>A.</span> Continental rifts appear as elongate valleys bounded on either side by faults. Volcanism occurs along the rift as asthenosphere rises to accommodate the thinning lithosphere and melts. Rifts can be found in east Africa and in the great basin of the western united states. \n                                </p>   \n                                  \n\n                <img src=\"/eedef9b3ae74d6119f5c683e4d03e678.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"topic__review-img\" width=\"50%\" height=\"50%\">\n            </div>\n\n        </div>\n\n        <footer>\n            <div class=\"footer-box\">\n                <div class=\"contact\" id=\"contact\">\n                \n                    <div class=\"contact-form\">\n                        <p class=\"contact-title\">Get In Touch</p>\n                        <form action=\"submit\" method=\"post\">\n                            <label for=\"fname\">First Name</label>\n                            <input type=\"text\">\n                            <label for=\"lname\">Last Name</label>\n                            <input type=\"text\">\n                            <label for=\"email\">Email</label>\n                            <input type=\"email\">\n                            <label for=\"message\">Leave me a message</label>\n                            <textarea name=\"message\" id=\"contact-message\" cols=\"25\" rows=\"5\"></textarea>\n\n                            <button class=\"form-btn\">Submit</button>\n                \n                        </form>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n                \n                <div class=\"footer-resources\">\n                    <p class=\"resources-title\">Great Geo Resources</p>\n                    <div class=\"resource-items\">\n                        <a href=\"https://geology.com\">geology.com</a>\n                        <a href=\"https://www.usgs.gov/\">USGS.gov</a>\n                        <a href=\"\"></a>\n                        <a href=\"\"></a>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n        \n            <div class=\"copyright-info\">\n        \n                <p><i class=\"fas fa-copyright\"></i> helpgeologyanswers 2022</p>\n            </div>\n\n\n    </footer></div>\n\n\n\n</body>\n\n</html>"},"sourceMaps":null,"error":null,"hash":"70cf5a95d43a5b1070d0c9038c73f1e9","cacheData":{}}
