The heliocentric model, which gained acceptance during the Renaissance, placed the sun at the center. </p> <p>Earth is one of eight planets orbiting the sun. this solar system lies on the outer edge of a slowly revolving galaxy, the milky way, which is composed of about 300 billion stars. The universe contains at least hundred of billions of galaxies. </p> <p>The red shift of light from distant galaxies led to discovery of expanding universe theory. Most astronomers agree that this expansion began after the big bang, a cataclysmic explosion about 13.7 billion years ago. The first atoms (hydrogen and helium) of the universe developed within minutes of the big bang. These atoms formed vast gas clouds, called nebulae. </p> <p>Gravity caused clumps of gas in the nebulae that coalesce into flattened disks with bulbous centers. The protostars at the center of these disks eventually became so dense and hot that fusion reactions began within them. When this happened, they because true stars, emitting heat and light. Earth, and the life forms on it contains elements that could have been produced only during the life cycle of stars.</p> <p>Thus, we are all made of stardust. Planets developed from the rings of gas and dust surrounding porotostars. The gas and dust condensed into planetesimals. Which then clumped together to form protoplanets. And finally true planets. Inner rings became the terrestrial planets; outer rings grew into giant planets. </p> <p>The moon formed from debris ejected when a protoplanet collided with earth in the young solar system. A planet assumes a near spherical shape when it becomes os soft that gravity smooth out irregularities. The earth has a magnetic field that shield it from solar wind and cosmic rays. The earth has a magnetic field that shield it from solar wind and cosmic rays. A layer of gas surround the earth. This atmosphere (78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen. 1% other gasses) can be subdivided into distinct layers. Air pressure decrease with increasing elevation. </p> <p>The surface of the earth ca be divided into land 30% and ocean 70%. the consist of organic chemicals, minerals, glasses, rocks metals melts, and volatiles. Most rocks o earth contain silicate. We distinguish among various major rock types based on the proportion of silica. </p> <p>The earth’s interior can be divided into three compositionally distinct layers: the very thick crust, the rocky mantle, and the metallic core. The crust is a thin skin that varies int thickness from 7-10km (beneath the oceans) to 25-70km beneath continents. Oceanic crust is magic in compositions, whereas average upper continental crust is felicity to intermediate. The mantel is composed of ultramafic rock. The core is made of iron alloy. </p> <p>Studies of seismic waves have revealed that the mantle cab be subdivided into an upper mantle including a transition zone and a lower mantle. The core cab be subdivided into the outer core liquid and an inner core solid. Circulation of the outer core produces the earths magnetic field. The crust plus the uppermost part of the mantle constitute the lithosphere. A relatively rigid sphere. The lithosphere overlies the asthenosphere, mantle that is capable of flowing by convection. </p> <img src="/FIG01.04d_ESSGEO4_CH01.f2d0f572.jpg" alt="" class="topic__summary-img" width="50%" height="50%"> </div> <div class="topic__key"> <strong>Key Topics</strong> <ul> <li> Big Bang Theory: Distant galaxies are uniformly red-shifted rather than blue-shifted; this implies that they are all moving away from us. The farthest galaxies are those that are most strongly red-shifted. Meaning that they are receding the fastest. Extrapolation of velocities and trajectories into the past suggest that all matter in the Universe was contained in a single point, approximately 13.7 billion years ago. At that time, the Universe explosively came into existence. </li> <li>Stars, including our sun, are nuclear fusion reactors. For most of their life histories (on the order of billions of years), hydrogen atoms are fused together to form helium. Later stages in stellar evolution include fusion of helium atoms and other, heavier elements; ultimately, iron is the heaviest element that can be produced through fusion reactions within stars. </li> <li>after their cycles of fusion are complete, nebular stars violently explode (forming supernovae), producing elements heavier than iron and leaving behind a residue of diffuse nebulae, which may be recycled to form a new star at some point in the future. </li> <li> Our sun is approximately 5 billion years old and is expected to continue fusing helium as it does today for about another 5 billion years. All eight planetary orbits are coplanar, and all the planets orbit in the same direction (counterclockwise as viewed from above Earth’s North Poole). These facts imply simultaneous planetary formation from a swirling conservation of angular momentum) the planets accreted from this nebular through gravitational attraction and haphazard collision. Pluto, long considered the “ninth planet” has seen ts status demoted; astronomers now recognize eight major planets. </li> <li>the terrestrial planets are relatively small, dense, and rocky worlds; they were depleted of the cosmically superabundant (but very light) elements hydrogen and helium. The giant planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune) retained these elements and are thus much larger and much less dense. (Saturn is less dense than water) </li> <li>our moon, responsible for the earth’s tides, has a chemistry similar to that of earths’ mantle; the moon is thought to have originated from debris accumulated when a mars-sized protoplast collided with Earth very early in its history. </li> <li>earth is chemically divided into a thin, rocky crust dominated by silicate minerals; a thick mantle composed mostly of iron- and magnesium-rich silicates (subject locally to partial melting); and a thick metallic core made primarily of iron, the outer portion is liquid. YOU should know that seismic waves tell us that the outer core must be liquid and that this liquid metallic layer generates earth's magnetic field </li> <li>- physically, the uppermost layers of Earth are the rigid lithosphere (crust and uppermost mantle) and the asthenosphere, which is softer and flows. The “plates” of plates tectonic theory are discrete slabs of lithosphere, which move with respect to one another atop the weaker asthenosphere </li> <li> earth is composed of a variety of materials with disparate physical properties (minerals, organics, metals, volatiles, and melts)</li> </ul> <img src="/FIG01.17_ESSGEO4_CH01.0b778be5.jpg" alt="" class="topic__key-img" width="100%" height="50%" object-fit="contain"> </div> <div class="topic__review"> <strong>Review Questions</strong> <p>1. Contrast the geocentric and heliocentric universe concepts.</p> <p> <span>Ans:</span> the geocentric concept placed Earth at the center of the Universe, with the Sun and the other planets revolving around it. The heliocentric concept placed the Sun at the center, with Earth and the other planets revolving around it</p> <p>2. Describe how the Doppler effect works.</p> <p> <span>Ans:</span> Sound waves (and light waves) emanating from an approaching source arrive at a higher frequency than they would if the object were stationary. This frequency shift arises because each successive sound wave is emanated from a closer distance than was the previous wave. Our brains interpret these high frequencies (after transmission through our ears as a higher pitch. Once a wave source passes an observer, its sound waves have a reduced frequency, as each wave is emitted from a slightly more distant point. </p> <p>3. What does the red shift of the galaxies tell us about their motion with respect to earth? </p> <p> <span>Ans:</span> all distant galaxies are moving away from our own, with the farthest galaxies moving the fastest </p> <p>4. What is the Big Bang, and when did it occur?</p> <p> <span>Ans: </span> The big Bang is an explosive phase of expansion of matter and space that occurred at the beginning of our Universe, 13.7 billion years ago.</p> <p>5. Describe the steps in the formation of our Solar System according to the nebular theory.</p> <p> <span>Ans: </span> The mass in our sun and the surround Solar system condensed from a swirling nebular *(cloud of gas and dust_. At the center of the nebular, most of the mass condensed to form the Sun, which graduate from protostar status when it becomes sufficiently massive – and thus hot enough – to fuse hydrogen. Within a flat protoplanetary disk surround the Sun, planets arose from gravity-driven accretion and the collision of smaller bodies termed planetesimals and protoplanets. Light gasses and other volatiles were ejected from the inner portion n of the disk as the Sun's heat intensified, so the terrestrial planets ended up as smaller spheres of relatively high density h refractory substances (rock and metal). Farther out, the giant planets incorporated an abundance volatiles such as hydrogen and helium to become much more massive but less dense</p> <p>6. why isn't the earth homogeneous? </p> <p><span>Ans: </span>Early in its history, the Earth was hot enough to be entirely molten. Within the melt, the denser iron alloy sank to the center of the sphere due to gravity, leaving the less dense rocky material to predominate the outer portion of the Earth. </p> <p>7. Describe how the Moon was formed.</p> <p><span>Ans:</span> The Moon Formed when a Mars -sized body collided with Earth early in the history of the Solar System. The force of the impact ejected materiel similar in composition to Earth’s mantle. This mantle like mass cooled and solidify, resulting in our Moon. </p> <p>8. Why is Earth round? </p> <p><span>Ans:</span> Gravity forces objects the size of Earth to be nearly spherical (the most compact shape, minimize the distance of points form the center </p> <p>9. What is the Earth’s Magnetic Field? What Causes the Aurora? </p> <p><span>Ans:</span> The magnetic field of Earth is a region of space affected by the magnetic for of Earth Charged particles comprising solar wind are pulled toward the poles by the magnetic field. There they interact with gas molecules high in the atmosphere to produce the aurora. </p> <p>10.What is Earth’s atmosphere composed of? Why would you die of suffocation if you were to eject from a fighter plane at an elevation of 12km without takin an oxygen tank with you? </p> <p><span>Ans: Earth’s atmosphere is mostly nitrogen (78%) and oxygen (21%), with minor amount of argon, carbon dioxide and other gases. The atmosphere becomes less and less dense with altitude; at 12 km, oxygen molecules are too sparse to support human life. </span> </p> <p>11.what is the proportion of land area to sear area on Earth? </p> <p><span>Ans: the proportion of land area to sear area is three to seven; earth consists of 30% land area and 70% sea area. </span> </p> <p>12. What are the principal layers of earth? </p> <p><span>Ans: The principles composition layers of Earth are the crust, mantel and core </span> </p> <p>13. How do temperature and pressure change with increasing depth in the earth? </p> <p><span>Ans: both temperature and pressure increase with increasing depth</span> </p> <p>14. what is the Moho? How was it fires recognized? Describe the difference between continental crust and oceanic crust. </p> <p><span>Ans: The Moho is the crust-mantle boundary, first recognized by and abrupt changed in seismic-wave velocities. Continental crust is thicker, less magic, and more available in continental than oceanic crust. </span> </p> <p>15. what is the mantle composed of? Is there any melt within the mantle? </p> <p><span>Ans: The mantle is mostly made of an ultramafic silicate rock termed peridotite. There is a small amount of melt in the upper mantle. </span> </p> <p>16. What is the core composed of? How do the inner core and outer core differ from each other? Which layer produces the magnetic field? </p> <p><span>Ans:</span> The core is mostly iron; the inner part is solid, whereas the outer part is liquid. Circulation of iron atoms in the liquid outer core generates the magnetic filed of the Earth. </p> <p>17. What is the difference between the lithosphere and the asthenosphere? Which layer is softer and flows more easily? At what depth does the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary occur? Is this above or below the Moho? Is the asthenosphere entirely liquid? </p> <p><span>Ans:</span> The lithosphere is relatively cool and rigid compared to the hot, soft asthenosphere, which flows more readily. The lithosphere consists of the crust 9oceanic basalt and gab bro, or continental granite) plus the uppermost mantle (peridotite) down to a depth of about 100 to 150lkm. This boundary lies below the Moho. The asthenosphere is only the molten (liquid) in places. </p> <p>18. the farther a galaxy lies from Earth, the greater its red shift. Why?</p> <p><span>Ans:</span> The galaxies that are farthest from earth will necessarily be those that have been traveling away from us most rapidly ever since the Big Bang.</p> <p>19. Did all first-generation stars form at the same time? Why or why not? </p> <p><span>Ans:</span> Not all first-generation stars would been born at exactly the same time. Star formation results from gravity pulling matter together out of more diffuse regular. Variation in nebular mass and density would assure that not all first generation stars were born at the same time, though all formed early in the history of the universe</p> <p>20. Why are the giant planets, which contain abundant gas and ice, farther from the Sun? </p> <p><span>Ans:</span> At great distance from the sun. these volatile materials were protected from solar wind. </p> <p>21.Recent observations suggest that the moon has a very small, solid core that is less than 3% of its mass. In comparison, earth’s core is about 33 of its mass. Explain why this difference might exist. </p> <p><span>Ans:</span> The moon is thought to have formed when a Mars -sized body collided with earth early in its history. The impact hurled a portion of earth. Mostly mantle materiel with no contribution form the core, into orbit about our earth, where it solidified to form our Moon. The moon differentiated but with a minute amount of iron compare to the Earth. </p> <p>22. the moon has virtually no magnetosphere. Why? </p> <p><span>Ans:</span> The moon has no liquid metallic layer inside the comparable to the earths outer core </p> <p>23. popular media sometimes imply that the crust floats on a sea of magma. Is this a correct image the mantle just below the Moho? Explain your answer. </p> <p><span>Ans:</span> </p> <p>24.</p> <p><span>Ans:</span> No, the mantel just beneath the crust is not only solid but rigid. Together with the crust, it forms the lithosphere, Below the lithosphere, even the asthenosphere is mostly solid, though and ductile. </p> </div> <div class="topic__img-container"> <img src="/FIG01.04d_ESSGEO4_CH01.f2d0f572.jpg" alt="" class="topic-img1"> <img src="/FIG01.13b_ESSGEO4_CH01.06f05951.jpg" alt="" class="topic-img2"> <img src="/FIG01.15ab_ESSGEO4_CH01.fb008d72.jpg" alt="" class="topic-img3"> <img src="/FIG01.17_ESSGEO4_CH01.0b778be5.jpg" alt="" class="topic-img4"> <img src="" alt="" class="topic-img5"> <img src="" alt="" class="topic-img6"> <img src="" alt="" class="topic-img7"> </div> </div> <footer> <div class="footer-box"> <div class="contact" id="contact"> <div class="contact-form"> <p class="contact-title">Get In Touch</p> <form action="submit" method="post"> <label for="fname">First Name</label> <input type="text"> <label for="lname">Last Name</label> <input type="text"> <label for="email">Email</label> <input type="email"> <label for="message">Leave me a message</label> <textarea name="message" id="contact-message" cols="25" rows="5"></textarea> <button class="form-btn">Submit</button> </form> </div> </div> <div class="footer-resources"> <p class="resources-title">Great Geo Resources</p> <div class="resource-items"> <a href="https://geology.com">geology.com</a> <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/">USGS.gov</a> <a href=""></a> <a href=""></a> </div> </div> </div> <div class="copyright-info"> <p><i class="fa-copyright fas"></i> helpgeologyanswers 2022</p> </div> </footer> </div> <script src="/earth.d979438b.js"></script> <script>AOS.init();</script> </body></html>
